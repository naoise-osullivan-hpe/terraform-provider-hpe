# hpe Provider

This is the hpe terraform provider which is still in development.  It will eventually replace the
[HPE GreenLake Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/HPE/hpegl/latest) and the
[Morpheus Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gomorpheus/morpheus/latest).

Initially this provider will support Morpheus, but will in time expand to cover other HPE offerings.

This provider requires 64-bit versions of the terraform binary to work properly.

## Morpheus

This provider can be used to manage Morpheus resources.  Support will grow over time.  See below for
release notes for the current version (v0.0.1).

### Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate with Morpheus:
1. Using a username and password
2. Using an access_token

With either method the URL of the Morpheus instance must be provided as `url`.

By default the provider will check the Morpheus server key and will fail if it is not valid.  This can be
be toggled off be setting `insecure` to `true` in the provider block.

### Example Usage

#### Using a username and password

```terraform
# Copyright 2025 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

terraform {
  required_providers {
    hpegl = {
      source  = "HPE/hpe"
      version = "= 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "hpe" {
  # Provide morpheus block if you want to create morpheus resources
  morpheus {
    username = "username"
    password = "password"
    url      = "https://morpheus.example.com"
  }
}
```

#### Using an access token

```terraform
# Copyright 2025 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

terraform {
  required_providers {
    hpegl = {
      source  = "HPE/hpe"
      version = "= 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "hpe" {
  # Provide morpheus block if you want to create morpheus resources
  morpheus {
    access_token = "access_token"
    url          = "https://morpheus.example.com"
  }
}
```

#### Using an access token with insecure

```terraform
# Copyright 2025 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

terraform {
  required_providers {
    hpegl = {
      source  = "HPE/hpe"
      version = "= 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "hpe" {
  # Provide morpheus block if you want to create morpheus resources
  morpheus {
    access_token = "access_token"
    insecure     = true
    url          = "https://morpheus.example.com"
  }
}
```
